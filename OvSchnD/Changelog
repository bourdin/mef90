- Ported to Petsc 2.3.1

- Moved IS_Nbr, M_Nbr, Mr_Nbr declaration in G_PU_2D_Scal_Dist, since they are not used outside of this subroutine



In m_OvScn2D_Proc.F90


Subroutine G_PU_2D_Scal_Dist
- Removed M_NBr, and computed Mr_Nbr directly
- removed the duplicate declaration of MyCount_function, MyCount_ID_Elem_Ghost, MyCount_Elem, MyCount_NodeGhost, MyCount_Node
(also declared as a global variable in m_OvSch2D_Var.F90)
- Removed MyPU_Old which is never used
- Moved the Statement 
   If (iO /= ovlp) Then 
      MyPU(:) = MyCount_ID_Node(:) + MyPU(:)
   EndIf
  out of the Do iO = 1, ovlp loop
- Removed unused variables: iB, iC, iBlock, Ir, iT, k1, k2, k3, k4, NV2, mcount
	

Subroutine Communicate_PU
- Moved Request and Status from m_OvSch2D_Vars.F90 into the subroutine since they are not used outside

- Removed unused variables j, Ir, Mv, flag
- Used MPI_Send instead of MPI_Isend. This should reduce the risks of deadlock

Subroutine Assemb_Coarse_Seq
- Moved the declaration of MyMRdotPU_Local from _Vars.F90
- Moved the declaration of Conum from _Vars.F90
- Moved the declaration of MRCO_IS from _Vars.F90
- DeAllocated MyMRdotMyPU, MyMRdotPU_Local, Conum
- Removed Unused variables k, Rr, val, flag, VV, MRCO_Ptr, MRCO_Seq_Ptr

Subroutine Coarse_Solve_Prep
- Removed unused variables j, ione
- Moved the declaration of MyPUSecIs from _Vars.F90
- DeAllocated MyPUSecIs
- Moved the declaration of CoSolMaster_Idx from _Vars.F90
- DeAllocated CoSolMaster_Idx
- CoIn_Seq is also created on cpu 1 .. numprocs-1 with size=0
- Moved the creation of CoVecScatter next to the creation of CoIn and CoOut

Subroutine Coarse_Solve_Seq
- Removed unused variables zz, i, j, ione, value, coarse_SOL, vecsize, Va, MyTS, MyTF
- The VecGhostUpdateBegin/End(RHS_Ov,... seem unneeded to me. 
  I commented them out without any effect on your code. Can you check that?
- Moved the creation of CoVecScatter into Coarse_Solve_Prep
- Used a MUCH simpler way to convert a MPI vector distributed accross cpu into
  a Sequential vector on CPU 0 (see attached docs)

Subroutine Set_OBDD
- Removed unused variables i, Numiter, MyOutSol_Ov
- Used a MUCH simpler way to convert a MPI vector distributed accross cpu into
  a Sequential vector on CPU 0 (see attached docs)

In m_OvSch2D_Vars.F90
- Removed unused variables:
	Tag, TagTmp, RequestTmp, StatusTmp
	Request2, Status2, Request2Tmp, Status2Tmp, CointoOut
- Removed variables made obsolete
	CoIn, CoIn_Ptr, Sol_CoInSeq_Ptr, SOL_CoIn
- Removed global variables that were not used to comuicate values in between subroutines
	vv, zz, Sol_Mangled, Mangle, Sol_ManToL2, Sol_Comp, StTmp, MyTmpList,
        MyTmpList2, NV, St, MyCoMR, MyCoarMR, MRCO_Seq, ZeroMyList, MRCoCOL, 
        MRIMP_Ov, CoMuMyPU

QUESTIONS:
Why is the final residual changing when I run the program on the same mesh?
Same with the total number of iterations?
